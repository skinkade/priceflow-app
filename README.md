# PriceFlow API

## Welcome

If you're seeing this, you're likely interested in the [Gleam Programming Language](https://gleam.run)! Please tread carefully when reading this code, there are a lot of experiments and things may look _radically different_ from one day to the next. I'm very open to discussions, contributions, and ideas, but I can't promise any reciprocation, merging, or anything else from my end. Thanks for understanding!

## Installation

1. After cloning the repository, type `gleam run` to build and run the application, or if you have `watchexec` installed, `make watch` to run the application in watch mode.
